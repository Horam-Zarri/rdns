## Why?
Residing in Iran, I encounter challenges in accessing various online resources due to the necessity of utilizing VPN software or DNS services.  
A large number of software are blocked in Iran due to US trade restrictions, and I need to change DNS frequently (e.g Some DNS that works for
ChatGPT doesn't work for downloading Nvidia drivers, and in case of games one that works for Battlefield doesn't work for CoD).  

Consequently, it can get extremely inconvenient and exhaustive to change my DNS settings manually everytime using the OS settings. While there are
some GUI apps available for managing DNS configurations, I perceive them as overly elaborate and often susceptible to the same 
repetitiveness. As a result I wrote rdns to make this faster for me and anyone who may also benefit from it.
